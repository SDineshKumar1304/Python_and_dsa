## 👋 Welcome to My Learning Journal!  

I'm **Dinesh Kumar**, a Junior Data Scientist and AI enthusiast, diving deeper into **Python**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to sharpen my coding and problem-solving skills. Follow along as I explore **Stack**, **Queue**, **Two Pointers**, **Sliding Window**, **Dictionary**, and **Linked List**!

## 💡 **Topics I'm Focusing On**  

### 🐍 **Python Fundamentals**  
- 🎯 Variables, Data Types, and Operators  
- 🎯 Control Structures: Loops, Conditional Statements  
- 🎯 Functions: Basics, Recursion, and Lambda Functions  

### 🏗️ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- 💡 Classes and Objects  
- 💡 Constructors and Destructors  
- 💡 Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel)  
- 💡 Polymorphism (Overloading and Overriding)  
- 💡 Encapsulation and Abstraction  

### 🧮 **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) is totlly using OOPs Concepts**  
- **Stack**:  
  - 🔄 Balanced Parentheses, Evaluate Postfix Expression  
  - 🔄 Implementing Stack Using Arrays or Lists
    
- 🧑‍🏫 **Sorting Algorithms**  
Mastering the following **sorting algorithms** and understanding their complexities:  
- **Merge Sort** (Divide and Conquer)  
- **Quick Sort** (Divide and Conquer)  
- **Insertion Sort** (Simple but inefficient for large datasets)  
- **Selection Sort** (Inefficient for large datasets, but good for small arrays)  
- **Bubble Sort** (Simple, but inefficient for large arrays)

- **Queue**:  
  - 🔄 Implementing Queue and Circular Queue  
  - 🔄 Problems: First Non-Repeating Character, Queue Using Stacks  

- **Two Pointers**:  
  - 🔄 Problems: Pair Sum, Three Sum, Container with Most Water  

- **Sliding Window**:  
  - 🔄 Problems: Maximum Sum Subarray, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  

- **Dictionary**:  
  - 🔄 Problems: Frequency Count, Anagram Groups, Subarray Sum Equals K  

- **Linked List**:  
  - 🔄 Basics: Singly and Doubly Linked Lists  
  - 🔄 Problems: Reverse a Linked List, Merge Two Sorted Lists, Detect Cycle in Linked List

## 🏆 **Goals**  
- [ ] 🎯 **Master Python Core and OOP Concepts**  
- [ ] 🎯 **Solve 50+ DSA problems**, focusing on Stack, Queue, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Dictionary, and Linked List.  
- [ ] 🎯 **Develop a mini-project** combining Python skills and DSA concepts.  

---

- 🔧 **Tools**:  
  - Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, Git for version control
